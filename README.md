# CS61A

### Brief

The first course in the Berkeley CS61 series, and my introduction to Python.

The CS61 series is an introductory course for the CS major at Berkeley, which includes:

CS61A: Emphasizes abstraction and teaches students to use programs to solve practical problems without focusing on the underlying hardware details.

CS61B: Focusing on algorithms and data structures and building large-scale programs, students will use the Java language to combine knowledge of algorithms and data structures to build large-scale projects at the level of thousands of lines of code (a simple Google Map, a two-dimensional version of Minecraft).

CS61C: Focuses on computer architecture, allowing students to understand how a high-level language (e.g. C) is translated step by step into machine-understandable 01 strings and executed in the CPU. Students will learn the RISC-V architecture and implement a CPU themselves with Logisim.

Going back to CS61A, note that this isn't just a programming language course, but rather a deep dive into how programs are built and run.Finally, we will implement a Scheme interpreter in Python for our fourth Project.In addition, abstraction will be a big theme of this course, and we'll learn about functional programming, data abstraction, object orientation, and more to make our code more readable and modular.Of course, learning programming languages is also a big part of this course. We will learn Python, Scheme and SQL, which are three programming languages. During the study and comparison, we believe that we will develop the ability to quickly master a new programming language.

### Plan

I decide to use 3 weeks to go throuogh the course and all the other work, since i got a strong fundenmentation, it should not be a hard task.
