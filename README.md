# CS61A

### Brief

The first course in the Berkeley CS61 series, and my introduction to Python.

CS61A, this isn't just a programming language course, but rather a deep dive into how programs are built and run.Finally, we will implement a Scheme interpreter in Python for our fourth Project.In addition, abstraction will be a big theme of this course, and we'll learn about functional programming, data abstraction, object orientation, and more to make our code more readable and modular.Of course, learning programming languages is also a big part of this course.
